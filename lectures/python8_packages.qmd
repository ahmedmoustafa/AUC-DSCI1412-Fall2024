## Packages for Data Analysis

We will be discussing key Python packages that are commonly used for data analysis such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **numpy**.

![Python Packages](images/packages.png)

## Packages in Python

- In Python, a *package* is a collection of modules organized within a directory structure, allowing developers to logically group related code components, such as functions, classes, and constants, into a single namespace. 
- This structure enables modularity and reuse across projects, making code easier to maintain, import, and share with others.
- The most common way to import a package is using the `import` statement followed by the name of the package.
- For example, to import the `math` package, we would use the following statement:

```{python}
#| echo: true
import math

math.sqrt(25)
```

##  Importing Packages with Aliases

- We can also import a package with an *alias* using the `as` keyword.
- This can be useful when we want to use a shorter name for a package in our code.
- For example, to import the `math` package with the alias `m`, we would use the following statement:

```{python}
#| echo: true
import math as m

m.sqrt(25)
```


## Installing a package

- If a package is not already installed, we can install within our notebook using:

```python
%pip install package_name
```
- Example to install **`pandas`**:

```python
%pip install pandas
```

(Note: `pip` stands for "Pip Installs Packages")

## `Pandas`

- `Pandas` is a Python package that is used for data manipulation and analysis.
- It provides data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating large datasets.

## The Titanic Dataset

![Titantic departing Southampton on April 10, 1912](https://media.gettyimages.com/id/188056589/photo/digitally-restored-vintage-maritime-history-photo-of-the-rms-titantic-departing-southampton-on.jpg?s=2048x2048&w=gi&k=20&c=UUgRikYArk0uhrOMQbs994YaoRuCWU4TrcsjYGI8Tj0=)

- The Titanic dataset contains data on the passengers of Titanic, including their survival status, age, gender, class, and other attributes.


## Loading a CSV file with Pandas

```{python}
#| echo: true
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/stuff/titanic.csv'
titanic = pd.read_csv(url) # Load Titanic dataset

titanic.shape # The dimension of the dataframe (the table)
```


## Viewing Data 1/2

- Once we have loaded data into a `DataFrame`, we can start exploring it using various Pandas functions.
- The `head()` and `tail` functions are useful functions for quickly viewing the first and last few rows of a `DataFrame`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
titanic.head() # Print the first few rows of the DataFrame
```

## Viewing Data 2/2

```{python}
#| echo: true
titanic.tail() # Print the last few rows of the DataFrame
```


## Basic Statistics

- We can use `Pandas` to calculate basic statistics on our data, such as mean, median, and standard deviation.

- The `describe()` function provides a summary of the basic statistics of each column in the DataFrame.

```{python}
#| echo: true
titanic.describe()
```


## Indexing and Selection 1/2

- We can use indexing and selection to retrieve specific data from a `DataFrame`.
- The `iloc[]` function is used for integer-based indexing, where we can specify the row and column numbers.

```{python}
#| echo: true
titanic.iloc[2:5]
```

## Indexing and Selection 2/2

- The `loc[]` function is used for label-based indexing, where we can specify the row and column labels.

```{python}
#| echo: true
titanic.loc[2:5, ['Survived', 'Pclass']]
```


## Filtering Data

- We can use Boolean indexing to filter data in a DataFrame based on a certain condition.

- For example, we can filter the Titanic dataset to only show passengers who survived:

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Filter Titanic dataset to only show passengers who survived
survivors = titanic[titanic['Survived'] == 1]
survivors.head()
```

## Grouping and Aggregation

- Grouping and aggregation are powerful tools for summarizing and analyzing data in a DataFrame.
- We can group data in a DataFrame based on one or more columns, and then apply an aggregation function like `sum()`, `mean()`, or `count()`.
- For example, we can group the Titanic dataset by ticket class and calculate the average age for each class:

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Group Titanic dataset by ticket class and calculate the average age for each class
age_by_class = titanic.groupby('Pclass')['Age'].mean()
age_by_class
```


## `Matplotlib`

- `Matplotlib` is a Python package used for creating data visualizations.
- It provides a wide range of tools for creating line plots, bar plots, histograms, scatterplots

## Plotting a Simple Line Graph with `Matplotlib`

![Power Station](https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1445772340/photo/drone-point-view-of-power-station.jpg?s=2048x2048&w=gi&k=20&c=qMVveLgAq5dCTOmPQ90ZSIAEJcQhuoOC9-jyRSBcFxM=)

- Let us start with an example of how to use Matplotlib to create a simple line graph for global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from 1960 to 2014.

- Here is the code to load the dataset:

```{python}
#| echo: true
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/co2-fossil-global/master/global.csv'
co2 = pd.read_csv(url)

co2.head()
```

:::{.fragment}

```{python}
#| echo: true
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(co2['Year'], co2['Total'])
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('CO2 Emissions (million metric tons)')
plt.title('Global CO2 Emissions from Fossil Fuels')
plt.show()
```

:::

## Creating a Bar Plot with `Matplotlib`

- We can also use `Matplotlib` to create a bar plot.
- Here is the code to load the dataset and create a bar plot:

```{python}
#| echo: true
plt.bar(age_by_class.index, age_by_class.values)

plt.title('Mean Age by Class')
plt.xlabel('Class')
plt.ylabel('Mean Age (Years)')

plt.show()
```


## `Numpy`

- `NumPy` is a Python package used for numerical computing.
- It provides a wide range of tools for working with arrays and matrices.
- `NumPy` is used in many scientific computing applications.

![NumPy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/NumPy_logo_2020.svg/1024px-NumPy_logo_2020.svg.png)

## Creating a `NumPy` Array

- To create a `NumPy` array, we can use the `numpy.array()` function.
- Here is the code to create a `NumPy` array:

```{python}
#| echo: true
import numpy as np

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr = np.array(data)
arr
```

## `NumPy` Array Operations

- We can perform various operations on `NumPy` arrays.
- For example, we can add, subtract, multiply, and divide arrays.
- Here is the code to add two arrays:

```{python}
#| echo: true
import numpy as np

arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
arr3 = arr1 + arr2
arr3
```


## `NumPy` Array Indexing and Slicing

- We can also index and slice `NumPy` arrays.
- Here is the code to create a `NumPy` array and slice it:

```{python}
#| echo: true
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr[2]
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
arr[1:4]
```


## `NumPy` Broadcasting

- **Broadcasting** is a powerful `NumPy` feature that allows us to perform operations on arrays of different shapes.
- Here is an example:

```{python}
#| echo: true
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D array of shape (3, 4)
arr1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                 [5, 6, 7, 8],
                 [9, 10, 11, 12]])

# Create a 1D array of shape (4,)
arr2 = np.array([2, 2, 2, 2])

# Add the 1D array to each row of the 2D array using broadcasting
result = arr1 + arr2

print(result)
```


- In this example, we have a 2D `NumPy` array `arr1` with shape `(3, 4)` and a 1D NumPy array `arr2` with shape `(4, )`. We want to add the values in `arr2` to each row of `arr1`.

- Normally, this operation would not be possible because the two arrays have different shapes.

- However, `NumPy` broadcasting allows us to perform this operation by "stretching" or "broadcasting" the 1D array to match the shape of the 2D array.

- In this case, `NumPy` broadcasts the 1D array `arr2` to a 2D array of shape `(3, 4)` by duplicating its values along the first dimension. This allows us to perform *element-wise* addition between the two arrays.

## `Seaborn`

- `Seaborn` is a Python data visualization package based on `Matplotlib`.
- It provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

![Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/_static/logo-wide-lightbg.svg)

- `Seaborn` works well with pandas dataframes and provides tools for visualizing relationships between variables.

```{python}
#| echo: true
import seaborn as sns
sns.countplot (data = titanic, x = 'Survived', hue = 'Sex')
```
